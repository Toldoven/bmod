### BMOD Autoload

- A quick way to play SoundEffect without a need for a SoundEffectPlayer
- You can use it to play SoundEffect after you free a scene. For example: when an entity dies
- `play_sfx(...)`, `play_sfx_2d(..., global_position: Vector2, ...)`, `play_sfx_3d(..., global_position: Vector3, ...)`

### RepeatSoundComponent Node

- You can preview the sound in the editor. Easy to tweak
	
## Project Settings
